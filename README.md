▶️ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally for development:

Prerequisites
You must have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

Installation
Clone the Repository:
git clone ymlab8-bogoso
cd ymlab8-bogoso
Install Dependencies:
npm install

The site will open in your browser at http://localhost:3000. Changes made to the code will refresh automatically.
🛠️ API & Mock Data Management
The components currently utilize mock data within their respective files (e.g., fetchQuizQuestions, initiatePaystackPayment).

To transition to the robust, live platform, you must:

Set up the Strapi Backend: Configure models for News, Awards, Programs, and deploy the Strapi instance.
Replace Mock Functions: Update the fetch* functions in the components (ContentFetcher.jsx, QuizComponent.jsx, etc.) to point to your live Strapi or booking API endpoints.
Configure Environment Variables: Add your payment gateway keys and API URLs to a .env file for security.
Variable (Example)	Purpose
REACT_APP_PAYSTACK_KEY	Public key for payment processing.
REACT_APP_CMS_API_URL	Base URL for the Strapi Content Management System.
🚀 Deployment
To deploy the production-ready version of the website:

Build the Project: This command optimizes and minifies all files into the build/ folder.
npm run build

Deploy: Upload the contents of the generated build folder to a static hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages. These services are highly recommended for optimal performance and simple continuous deployment.
